## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Zpendr follows a **Clean Architecture-inspired** layering model:

```text
Presentation Layer   → Widgets, Screens, State Providers
Domain Layer         → Entities, Use Cases, Business Rules
Data Layer           → Models, Repositories, Local/Remote Sources
```

### Why this architecture?
- **Scalability:** easy to expand features without rewriting the app.
- **Testability:** domain logic remains isolated and test-friendly.
- **Maintainability:** clean separation between UI and data access.
